# lab1 GayCode, Adder, Comperator
## Exp
1. **Design and verify a binary-to-Gray-code converter for a Gray code sequence with 10 code words *(input: abcd, output: wxyz, a and w are the MSB)*.**
    1. Derive the Boolean function/logic equation.
    2. Draw the related logic diagram.
    3. Construct the Verilog RTL code for the converter and use a testbench to simulate the logic behavior for verification.

2. **Design a signed 4-bit binary adder/subtractor with input a (a3a2a1a0), b (b3b2b1b0), m as the operator control (0 for addition and 1 for subtraction); output s (s3s2s1s0), v as overflow indicator.**
    1. Derive the Boolean function/logic equation.

    3. Construct the Verilog RTL code for the function and use a given testbench to simulate the logic behavior for verification.

3. **<font color = red>(Bonus)</font> For three 3-bit signed numbers a (a2a1a0), b (b2b1b0), and c (c2c1c0), build a logic circuit to output o(o2o1o0) as the smallest number and use a given testbench for verification**
