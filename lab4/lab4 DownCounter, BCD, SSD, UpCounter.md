# lab4 DownCounter, BCD, SSD, UpCounter
## Exp
1. **Construct a `4`-bit synchronous binary down counter *(b3b2b1b0)* with the `1`-Hz clock frequency from lab3 and use `4` LEDs to show the binary values.**

2. **Combine the `4`-bit synchronous binary down counter from exp1 with a binary-to-seven-segment-display decoder *(from lab2)* to show the binary counting in 7-segment display.**
3. **Construct a single digit BCD down counter with a `2`-Hz clock as the clock frequency anddisplay on the seven-segment display.**
    1. Construct a single digit BCD down counter.
    2. Construct a BCD-to-seven-segment display decoder.
    3. Combine the above two together.
4. **Construct a `2`-digit BCD up counter with a `1`-Hz clock as the clock frequency and display on the seven-segment display.**
